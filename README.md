# Folder to show a small sample of my schoolwork.

Keep in mind that the coding is done to fulfill demands from professors, not necessarily to be elegant and clean :)
## Presentation_interview:
Presentation for job interview fall 2019.

## Deep_learning.py:
Project in TMA4315 Numerical mathematics.
Given red/blue points with coordinates in R^4, make a neural network to predict the color of new points.

## Diabetes_classification.R:
Project in TMA4268 Statistical learning.
Fit different models to a dataset and evaluate the models.
Fitted decision K-nearest neighbours, trees, support vector machine, neural network.

## Optimisation_problem.py:
Project in TMA4180 Optimisation.
Render points in R^2 and label them 0 or 1. Then use different optimisation algorithms to find an (or the) ellipse containing as many 1-points as possible and as few 0-points as possilble.
Used gradient descent, conjugate gradient, bfgs and a barrier method.
