## Folder to show a small sample of my schoolwork.

Keep in mind that the coding is done to fulfill demands from professors, not to be efficient or very elegant :)

# Deep_learning.py:
Project in TMA4315 Numerical mathematics.
Given red/blue points with coordinates in R^4, make a neural network to predict the color of new points.

# Diabetes_classification.R:
Project in TMA4268 Statistical learning.
Fit different models to a dataset and evaluate the models.
Fitted decision K-nearest neighbours, trees, support vector machine, neural network.

# Optimisation_problem.py:
Project in TMA4180 Optimisation.
Render points in R^2 and label them a or b. Then use different optimisation algorithms to find the ellipse containing as many a-points as possible and as few b-points as possilble.
Used gradient descent, conjugate gradient, bfgs and a barrier method.
